  BUILDING:
  =============

  This program should be built using Maven 2. The easiest way of
  generating a final, distributable package is by typing:

      mvn package

  This will create a zip file containing everything needed to start it
  up in the "target" folder.

  If you happen use Eclipse, you can type "mvn eclipse:eclipse" to
  create project files, and then simply import the project. Use a
  Maven Eclipse plugin as well (M2Eclipse is good).


  DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
  ====================

  src/
      main/
          Java files and resources needed by the application.

      test/
          Java files and resources for the automated tests (not
          avaliable in the distribution).

  distribution/
      Files used in the final distribution generated by the Maven
      assembly plugin.

  maven2/
      Any APIs that aren't available in the standard public Maven
      repository.
