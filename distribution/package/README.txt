  ABOUT:
  =============

  Trumpeter is a stand-alone server that integrates RT (Request
  Tracker) with an XMPP chat server (used by Jabber, Pidgin, Google
  Talk, etc.). It queries RT at regular intervals, and posts
  notification messages in chat rooms whenever new tickets arrive,
  warnings when they have been left untouched for too long, and
  optionally additional information about the flow of each ticket.

  See the Freshmeat entry for documentation, source code, bug reports
  and anything else related to the project:
