  ABOUT:
  =============

  Trumpeter is a stand-alone server that integrates RT (Request
  Tracker) with an XMPP chat server (used by Jabber, Pidgin, Google
  Talk, etc.). It regularly queries RT, and posts notification messages
  in chat rooms based on a configurable set of rules.


  See the project page for documentation, source code, bug reports and
